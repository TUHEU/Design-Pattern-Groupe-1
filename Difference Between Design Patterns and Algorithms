### **Difference Between Design Patterns and Algorithms (Point Form)**

* **Purpose**

  * Design Patterns: Solve **software design and architecture problems**
  * Algorithms: Solve **computational and logical problems**

* **Level of Abstraction**

  * Design Patterns: **High-level** (class structure and object interaction)
  * Algorithms: **Low-level** (step-by-step procedures)

* **Nature**

  * Design Patterns: **Conceptual solutions** or templates
  * Algorithms: **Concrete instructions** to follow

* **Focus**

  * Design Patterns: **How components are organized**
  * Algorithms: **How a task is executed**

* **Reusability**

  * Design Patterns: Reusable **design ideas**
  * Algorithms: Reusable **exact procedures**

* **Implementation**

  * Design Patterns: Can be implemented in **different ways**
  * Algorithms: Implemented in a **specific way**

* **Output**

  * Design Patterns: Well-structured and maintainable code
  * Algorithms: A computed result

* **Examples**

  * Design Patterns: Singleton, Factory, Observer
  * Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Pathfinding
