Types of Design Patterns
i. Creational Design Patterns
Concerned with object creation mechanisms.
ii. Structural Design Patterns
Concerned with class and object composition.
iii. Behavioral Design Patterns
Concerned with object interaction and responsibility.
CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERNS
1. Singleton Pattern
Intent
Ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global access point to it.
Motivation
Useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions (e.g., database connection, configuration manager).
Structure
Private constructor
Static instance
Public static method to access instance

2. Factory Method Pattern
Intent
Define an interface for creating objects but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Motivation
Avoid tight coupling between code and object creation.
Structure
Product interface
Concrete products
Factory class

3. Builder Pattern
Intent
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.
Motivation
Useful when an object has many optional parameters.

STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERNS
1. Adapter Pattern
Intent
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
Motivation
Used when existing classes cannot work together due to incompatible interfaces.

2. Decorator Pattern
Intent
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Motivation
Avoid subclass explosion.

3. Facade Pattern
Intent
Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

BEHAVIORAL DESIGN PATTERNS
1. Observer Pattern
Intent
Define a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all dependents are notified.

2. Strategy Pattern
Intent
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.

3. Command Pattern
Intent
Encapsulate a request as an object.
